<h1>Introduction</h1>


<b>Every author</b>, I suppose, has in mind a setting in which readers of his or her
work could benefit from having read it. Mine is the proverbial office
watercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged. I hope
to enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the
judgments and choices of others, the company’s new policies, or a
colleague’s investment decisions. Why be concerned with gossip?

<p>Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and
label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what
we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult
when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions
of others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues
will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated
judgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a
powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year
resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home.</p>

<h2>Two systems</h2>
<p>Psychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the
two modagee fi Pn="cees of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry
woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for
them.</p> <p>I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith
Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind,
System 1 and System 2.</p>
